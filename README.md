Project Description/Outline:
	Analysis of Job Turnover and Separation because of COVID-19 by using Texas Market Data, Covid Tracking Data and Bureau of Labor Statistics.

•	United States and Texas Unemployment Rate Comparison by providing geospatial visualizations specifically delta change per County between July 2019 and July 2020 
•	Texas Labor Market Analysis for Percent Women and Men COVID Positive Tests with a Line Graph over April 2020 to August 2020
•	Total claims for Houston between Jan 2019 to July 2020 with a Line Graph  
•	Percent of Unemployment Rate by Men, Women and Teenagers with a Line Graph
•	Bar graph comparison of Positive Tests Per Month for Texas and New York
•	Comparing Industry by Industry Annual % Change of Unemployment Rate via Bar Graph
•	Statistical Analysis 


Research Questions and Answers:
1.	Make an Assumption – Unemployment Rates and Claims are directly correlated to COVID-19 cases/deaths (Comparing July 2019 and July 2020 data)
2.	Have any specific industries affected more than others?
3.	Which age-group is most impacted?
4.	Compare TX and NY and perform t-tests, calculate p-value etc.
5.	




Data Sets to be Used:
	Patient COVID-19 Test Results (.csv file)
	Api.tracking.com - Daily by State (TX and NY)
	Bureau Labor Statistics (BLS) TX Data ? (Free API) – version 2
	Texas Labor Market Labor Data (.csv file)

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
•	Creating the GitHub – Tia – Done
•	Obtain data sets from the hospital – Janette 
•	Clean up COVID-19 API – Krishna
•	Clean up BLS API – Anthony			 
•	Create MatPlotLib Visualizations:
o	(2) Geo Map Visualizations – Krishna
o	(3) Line Graphs – Date/Time – Anthony & Janette
o	(2) Bar Graphs – Tia
o	(2) Scatter Plot – Josh		 
•	Statistic Measures and Box Plot – Josh 
•	Write Up/Presentation (Power Point and Readme) – ALL 


Conclusions:
1.	We assumed that there is a direct correlation between Unemployment Rates and Claims to COVID 19 cases across Counties in TX 
2.	We assumed that positive COVID 19 cases will go down as parents that were laid off stayed home but we proved that it is not the case
3.	There were more women that were unemployed than men
4.	The highest impacted age groups were teenagers between 16-19
5.	We concluded that most industries were impacted both positively and negatively due to COVID-19
6.	Couriers and Messengers industry has positive growth and support activities for Mining (suppliers, transportation and materials)
